# NEAT_for_Godot
## WORK IN PROGRESS- A proper readme, a wiki, a video and a binary will be added soon
An implementation of Kenneth O. Stanley's NEAT Algorithm for the Godot game engine, written in gdscript.

## credits
The NEAT algorithm was originally conceived by
[Kenneth O. Stanley](https://www.cs.ucf.edu/~kstanley/).

Matt Buckland's [AI Techniques for Game Programming](https://www.amazon.de/Techniques-Programming-Premier-Press-Development/dp/193184108X)
inspired me to undertake this project, and the c++ snippets included in the NEAT
chapter were a great resource for starting off.

The font used in this project is google's

And **of course** special thanks to the [godot](https://godotengine.org/) project
and all it's contributors.
